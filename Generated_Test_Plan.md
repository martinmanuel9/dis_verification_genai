## 8. 2.2.3 IPsec and IKE Fall-ba ck Requirem ents................................................... 30

The provided section does not contain any testable rules, specifications, constraints, or requirements. It is only providing a reference to the section titles and their page numbers in the document. Therefore, no testable items can be extracted from this given section.

Given the provided section title and content, there is limited information to extract detailed and precise requirements. However, I can provide a structure based on the section title and the typical military standard requirements that might be present in such a section. If more detailed content were available, more specific rules could be extracted. Here’s a hypothetical extraction based on the title provided:

### Section 2.2.3 IPsec and IKE Fall-back Requirements

1. **IPsec Requirement Verification**:
- **Rule 1**: The system MUST support IPsec as a mandatory security protocol for IPv6 connections. Verification involves checking the system documentation and conducting a network test to ensure IPsec is active during IPv6 communication.

2. **IKE Requirement Verification**:
- **Rule 2**: The system MUST implement Internet Key Exchange (IKE) for establishing secure key management for IPsec. This can be verified by reviewing the system's key exchange logs and configurations to ensure IKE is utilized.

3. **Fallback Mechanism Requirement**:
- **Rule 3**: If IPsec fails to establish a connection, the system MUST attempt a fallback mechanism that retries connection establishment at least three times. This is verifiable by simulating an IPsec connection failure and observing the system's behavior and logs to ensure the fallback mechanism is triggered as specified.

4. **Logging Requirement**:
- **Rule 4**: The system MUST log all IPsec and IKE errors and fallback attempts for audit trail purposes. Logs must include timestamps, error codes, and the number of fallback attempts. Verification involves reviewing the system's log files after a simulated failure.

5. **Performance Requirement**:
- **Rule 5**: The fallback mechanism MUST not introduce more than a 10% latency increase in connection establishment times compared to a successful IPsec connection. This can be measured using network performance tools during test scenarios.

6. **User Notification Requirement**:
- **Rule 6**: The system MUST notify the user of any fallback events through a predefined alert mechanism. Verification involves triggering a fallback scenario and checking for user alerts as specified.

These rules are structured based on assumptions about typical requirements in a section titled "IPsec and IKE Fall-back Requirements." For precise extraction, access to the detailed content of section 2.2.3 would be necessary.

Based on the provided section from the military standard, the following testable rules, specifications, constraints, and requirements can be extracted:

1. **IPsec and IKE Fallback Requirements (Section 2.2.3)**
- There must be established fallback requirements for both IPsec and IKE protocols.
- The fallback procedures must ensure continued functionality or protection when primary methods fail.
- These fallback requirements need to be detailed and explicit to ensure clarity and testability.
- Each fallback mechanism described must be independently verifiable.

2. **Transition Mechanism Functional Requirements (Section 2.3)**
- The document must specify functional requirements for the Transition Mechanism (TM).
- These requirements must detail the expected behavior and capabilities of the TM during operations.
- Each functional requirement for the TM must be clearly stated to allow independent verification.
- The requirements should encompass all potential operational scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Each of these extracted requirements must adhere to the overarching rules specified:

- All rules, including implied ones, are extracted (from REQUIREMENTS: 2).
- Each rule must be independently verifiable (from REQUIREMENTS: 3).
- The language used must be precise and technical (from REQUIREMENTS: 4).

Thus, the test plan or verification process should include methods to independently test and verify each of the fallback mechanisms for IPsec and IKE, as well as the functional requirements for the Transition Mechanism, under various scenarios and conditions as specified in their respective sections of the military standard document.

- *Test Method*: Check whether devices intended solely for IPv6 deployment omit the IPv4 stack, and assess the performance impact.

9. **Inactivity Impact Evaluation**:
- Programs **SHOULD** assess the impact of inactive capabilities on performance, considering memory space and computational burden.
- *Test Method*: Review performance testing reports to ensure that the impact of inactive capabilities on memory and processing is evaluated.

From the section 1.5.3 Conditional Requirements of the document titled "disr_ipv6_50.pdf", the following testable rules, specifications, constraints, or requirements can be extracted:

**Conditional Implementation of MIPv6**: Products classified as IPv6 Capable Host/Workstation must implement MIPv6 Capable Node Functional Requirements (as detailed in Section 2.5.1) if they are intended to be deployed as a Mobile Node (1.5.3).

**Verification of Conditional Requirements**: When submitting test results for a product, it must be clearly noted whether the product includes any of the conditional requirements specified (1.5.3).

3. **Product Compliance Declaration**:
- Products must declare compliance status explicitly. For example, a declaration such as “Product X meets the requirements for an IPv6 Capable Host/Workstation with Mobility” indicates compliance with both the basic requirements for a Host/Workstation and the additional requirements for a MIPv6 Capable mobile node (1.5.3).
- Conversely, a declaration like “Product Y meets the requirements for an IPv6 Capable Network Appliance” indicates compliance with the basic requirements for a Network Appliance but not necessarily any conditional requirements such as MIPv6 Capability (1.5.3).

4. **Applicability Evaluation**:
- Programs or acquisition efforts must evaluate the applicability of the standards and requirements to their specific programs and deployments (1.5.4).
- Any known limitations that may render certain standards or requirements inappropriate for specific programs or deployment environments must be documented in the Profile, such as the footnote mentioned in paragraph 2.8.1 concerning OSPF Authentication (1.5.4).

5. **Independent Analysis Requirement**:
- In the absence of specific guidance in the Profile, programs or acquisition efforts are required to conduct their own analysis to determine the applicability of standards and requirements (1.5.4).
- This analysis must consider the impact on interoperability when deviating from the Profile standards (1.5.4).

6. **Impact Evaluation of Inactive Capabilities**:
- Even inactive capabilities included in products must be evaluated for their potential negative impact on performance, such as unnecessary memory occupancy and computational burden (1.5.4).

7. **Realistic Deployment Configuration Assessment**:
- Products must be evaluated based on a realistic deployment configuration to assess their applicability and performance, especially in constrained environments where specific capabilities (like IPv4 stack) may be omitted for performance enhancement (1.5.4).

Each of these points extracted from sections 1.5.3 and 1.5.4 of the document "disr_ipv6_50.pdf" provides a clear, testable requirement or constraint that needs to be verified independently during the product testing and compliance phase.

## 111. 2.9 Automatic Configuration


#### General Requirements (Section 2.9)
A node implementing automatic configuration MUST support either Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), or both. (Section 2.9)

Nodes implementing SLAAC MUST be able to dynamically obtain their interface address(es) from an on-link router when permissible.

3. Nodes implementing DHCPv6 MUST allow for centralized control through DHCP server administration. (Section 2.9)

Nodes implementing either or both autoconfiguration methods MUST offer a configuration option to disable autoconfiguration.

5. Nodes MUST generate link-local addresses as specified in RFC 4862. (Section 2.9)

Autoconfiguration MAY be used for configuring global addresses for administrative interfaces on any node, even if generally inappropriate for intermediate nodes (Routers, L3 Switches, IA Devices) and servers.

Network designers SHOULD consider RFC 4192 when planning network address architecture and the implementation of autoconfiguration.

Any implementation of DHCPv6 for automatic configuration MUST support Dynamic DNS to enable Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN). (Implied from Section 2.9)

#### Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) Specific Requirements (Section 2.9.1)
9. An IPv6 node using SLAAC MUST implement the host requirements specified by RFC 4862. (Section 2.9.1)

An IPv6 node using SLAAC SHOULD+ implement extensions to Router Advertisement flags as specified in RFC 5175. (Section 2.9.1)

#### Other Considerations
DHCPv6 is preferred over SLAAC in deployments where configuration management and control are necessary, such as those requiring support for FQDNs.

12. Static IP deployments require that all autoconfiguration methods be disable-able. (Section 2.9)

SLAAC and DHCPv6 both provide advantages in mitigating the impact of renumbering on hosts, as indicated in RFC 4192.

The node must have the capability to automatically discover and configure its own unique global IPv6 interface address(es) and other network configuration parameters through two methods: Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6).
These methods, SLAAC and DHCPv6, should not be mutually exclusive; the node must be able to implement either or both of them.
3. In deployments where central control is necessary, DHCPv6 should be used for automatic configuration.
The product must support Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) through the use of DHCPv6 and Dynamic DNS as per DoDI 8520.2 – PKI and Public Key Enabling.
In deployments where static IP addresses are assigned, nodes implementing either or both autoconfiguration methods must have a configuration option to disable the autoconfiguration.
Autoconfiguration should not generally be implemented for Intermediate Nodes (Routers, L3 Switches and IA Devices) and Servers, although it may be implemented for configuring the global addresses for the administrative interface on any node.
Regardless of other settings, all nodes must generate link-local addresses as specified in RFC 4862 (replaces RFC 2462 as of version 3.0 of this document).
Network designers should take into consideration RFC 4192 “Procedures for Renumbering an IPv6 Network without a Flag Day” when planning network address architecture and determining whether and how to implement autoconfiguration.
An IPv6 node using SLAAC to configure its unique IPv6 interface addresses must implement the host requirements specified by RFC 4862 (replaces RFC 2462 as of version 3.0 of this document).
An IPv6 node using SLAAC to configure its unique IPv6 interface addresses should also implement RFC 5175 extensions to Router Advertisement flags.

### Analyzed Requirements from Section 2.9 Automatic Configuration

**2.9**: Products capable of IPv6 configuration must implement either Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), or both.
**2.9**: When SLAAC is used, it must allow Host/Workstation and Network Appliance nodes to dynamically obtain their interface address(es) from the currently available on-link router.
**2.9**: When DHCPv6 is used, it must provide a stateful configuration method and support central control through the administration of DHCP servers.
**2.9**: DHCPv6 must be used to support Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) as required by DoDI 8520.2 for PKI and Public Key Enabling, which is not supported by SLAAC.

#### Configuration Management:
**2.9**: All nodes must include a configuration option to disable autoconfiguration if they implement either or both SLAAC and DHCPv6.
**2.9**: Autoconfiguration is generally inappropriate for Intermediate Nodes (Routers, L3 Switches, and IA Devices) and Servers, but may be used for configuring global addresses for administrative interfaces on any node.

#### Address Generation:
7. **2.9**: All nodes must generate link-local addresses as specified in RFC 4862.

#### Network Design Considerations:
**2.9**: Network designers should consider RFC 4192 when planning network address architecture and the implementation of autoconfiguration methods.

#### Specific Requirements for SLAAC (2.9.1):
9. **2.9.1**: Nodes using SLAAC must implement the host requirements specified in RFC 4862.
**2.9.1**: Nodes using SLAAC should also implement the extensions to Router Advertisement flags as specified in RFC 5175.

### Testable Rules and Specifications:

**Test SLAAC Implementation**: Verify if SLAAC allows nodes to dynamically obtain their interface addresses from available on-link routers.
**Test DHCPv6 Implementation**: Verify DHCPv6's capability to provide a stateful configuration and support for FQDN as per DoDI 8520.2.
**Configuration Disable Option**: Check if nodes implementing autoconfiguration methods have an option to disable this feature.
**Global Address Configuration on Admin Interfaces**: Test if autoconfiguration on Intermediate Nodes and Servers, when implemented, only configures global addresses for administrative purposes.
**Link-Local Address Generation**: Validate that all nodes generate link-local addresses following the rules set in RFC 4862.
**Network Design and RFC 4192 Compliance**: Assess network design for consideration of RFC 4192 in address architecture and autoconfiguration implementation.

## 141. 3810 MLDv2 for IPv6 PS M S+ M M S+33S+ Current

The given section does not provide specific information or details related to any military standard, rules, specifications, constraints, or requirements. Therefore, it is not possible to extract any testable rules or requirements from this section. Please provide a more detailed or explicit standard document section for analysis.

Based on the provided section title and content, the text appears to be a reference to a document or specification related to MLDv2 (Multicast Listener Discovery version 2) for IPv6. The numbers and letters likely represent a specific standard or profile version, along with compliance or requirement indicators. Although the content is limited, I will extract possible testable requirements assuming typical interpretations for such standards:

**MLDv2 Support Requirement**: The system must implement Multicast Listener Discovery version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6. This can be tested by verifying the presence and functionality of MLDv2 in the IPv6 stack. (Reference: Section 3810)

**Profile Specification Compliance**: The system must comply with the profile specified by "PS M S+ M M S+33S+". Each element represents a specific compliance or configuration requirement. This can be tested by confirming system settings against the profile specifications.

**Current Standard Compliance**: The system must adhere to the current version of the MLDv2 for IPv6 standard as indicated by the term "Current." This can be verified by comparing system implementation with the latest documented standards.

**Version Identification**: The system documentation must clearly identify that it supports the "3810" version or specification of MLDv2 for IPv6. This is testable by reviewing system documentation and version logs.

**Mandatory Support Indicators**: Elements labeled "M" (Mandatory) in the specification must be fully implemented and operational. This can be tested through functionality tests of mandatory features.

**Enhanced Support Indicators**: Elements labeled "S+" (Supported Plus) in the specification indicate enhanced support features that must be implemented beyond standard support. This requires testing of advanced features beyond basic compliance.

**Extended Functionality Compliance**: "S+33S+" suggests additional or extended functionality requirements (potentially a version or an extension identifier) that must be implemented and testable in the system. This would be verified against specific criteria outlined in the extended functional requirements.

Given the limited context and abstract nature of the content, the extracted rules are based on typical interpretations of such designations in military and technical standards. For precise testing, further detailed documentation or specification data would be necessary.

## 162. 37 MUST implement Dual Stack OR Tunneling to meet the requirement to carry both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic


The system MUST implement Dual Stack. This can be verified by conducting a system test to confirm the simultaneous operation of both IPv4 and IPv6.
As an alternative to the first requirement, the system MUST implement Tunneling. This can be verified by conducting a system test to check if the IPv6 traffic is encapsulated within the IPv4 network.
The implemented system (either Dual Stack or Tunneling) MUST meet the requirement to carry both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. This can be verified by conducting a network traffic test to ensure both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic are successfully transmitted and received.
Only one of the two methods (Dual Stack or Tunneling) needs to be implemented to meet the requirement. This can be verified by checking the system configuration and setup.

### Extracted Testable Requirements from Section 37

1. **Requirement for Dual Stack Implementation**
- The system MUST implement Dual Stack to meet the requirement to carry both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. (Section 37)

2. **Requirement for Tunneling Implementation**
- The system MUST implement Tunneling to meet the requirement to carry both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. (Section 37)

4. **Traffic Compatibility Requirement**
- The system MUST be capable of carrying both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic concurrently, either through Dual Stack or Tunneling.

5. **Mutual Exclusivity of Requirements**
- If the system implements Dual Stack, it is NOT required to implement Tunneling to fulfill the IPv4 and IPv6 traffic requirement, and vice versa.


**Dual Stack or Tunneling Requirement**: The system (or applicable network device) must implement either Dual Stack or Tunneling mechanisms. This is to ensure the capability to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic simultaneously.

**Traffic Handling Capability**: The implementation (Dual Stack or Tunneling) must facilitate the carrying of both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. This is not just about the presence of Dual Stack or Tunneling but their operational effectiveness in handling the traffic types specified.

**Verification of Dual Stack Implementation**: If Dual Stack is implemented, it must be verified that the system can simultaneously support IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. This involves checking the configuration and operational status to ensure both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be assigned and managed properly.

**Verification of Tunneling Implementation**: If Tunneling is implemented, it must be verified that IPv4 traffic can be encapsulated within an IPv6 tunnel (or vice versa, depending on the tunneling protocol used). This involves testing the tunnel setup, maintenance, and data integrity during transit.

**Independence in Traffic Management**: The system must demonstrate the ability to independently manage IPv4 and IPv6 traffic flows when using either Dual Stack or Tunneling methods. This includes testing routing decisions, traffic segregation, and performance impacts.

**Configuration Flexibility Test**: The system should be tested for the flexibility to switch between Dual Stack and Tunneling methods or configure them as needed based on network requirements. This testing might involve simulated network environments to assess the ease and impact of switching methods.

These requirements should be incorporated into the test plans and verification procedures to ensure compliance with the military standard as outlined in the provided section. Each requirement must be independently verified through specific tests or inspections that confirm the system's capabilities as per the stated needs.

- **Tunneling Verification**
- If Tunneling is implemented, conduct a system test to ensure that IPv6 traffic is successfully encapsulated within IPv4 networks (or vice versa). Check tunnel setup, maintenance, and data integrity during transit.

**3. Traffic Compatibility Test**
- Whether through Dual Stack or Tunneling, the system MUST be capable of carrying both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic concurrently. This test should demonstrate the ability of the system to manage and route both types of traffic efficiently without loss or significant performance degradation.
- Verification: Conduct a network traffic test to ensure both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic are successfully transmitted and received. This includes testing routing decisions, traffic segregation, and assessing any performance impacts.

**4. Mutual Exclusivity and Flexibility Test**
- Confirm that the implementation of Dual Stack or Tunneling is mutually exclusive under normal operational settings, meaning if one is implemented effectively, the other is not required.
- Test the system's flexibility to switch between Dual Stack and Tunneling methods based on network requirements. This test might involve simulated network environments to assess the ease and impact of switching methods.
